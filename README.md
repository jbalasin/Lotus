A Machine Learning Library in Scala

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning library with similar functionality to that of Python's numpy. It is also an oppurtunity to for me to learn the ins and outs of these algorthims at a more computational level.

## Progress
Currently I am in the middle of building the basis for a compact Matrix and Vector class that is capable of doing the required linear algebra for the rest of the learning algorthims. Concurrently, I have also taken the first steps in the creating linear regression and artificial nueral network algorithms.

My initial intent is to get these up and running and then seeking optimization for certain portions (such as switching matrix multiplication to something like Strassen's).
